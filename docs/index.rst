.. caution::
    This training assumes that you have completed Train C, 
    a comprehensive programming course using the C language. 
    You are expected to be familiar with:

    * Fundamental programming concepts (variables, control flow, functions)
    * Basic data types and operators
    * Manual memory management and pointers (from a C perspective)
    * Writing, compiling, and debugging code in a structured programming environment

While Python differs significantly from C in syntax and style, your understanding of core programming logic from Train C will serve as a strong foundation for transitioning into Pythonâ€™s more dynamic and high-level features.
